_What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):_

  Traditional programming focuses primarily on writing code to solve specific problems, software engineering involves a broader scope, encompassing the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). 
  
  SDLC :
  
     Analysis:
     
       In this phase, the needs of the users and other stakeholders are gathered and documented. This phase involves feasibility studies, risk analysis, and requirements specification.
    
    Design:
        The design phase involves creating the architecture of the software system. This includes defining the system components, their interfaces, and data flows. High-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD) are created during this phase.
    Emplementation (Coding):
        During implementation, the design is translated into executable code. Programmers write code in the chosen programming language(s), following the design specifications.
    Testing:
        The testing phase involves verifying that the software works as intended. Various types of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance) are conducted to identify and fix defects.
    Deployment:
        In the deployment phase, the software is delivered to the users and installed in their environment. This may include configuring hardware and software, training users, and providing support.
    Maintenance:
        After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is updated and improved based on user feedback, bug reports, and changing requirements. Maintenance includes corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive activities.

**Question 3:**
_Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:_
 
 Waterfall Model:
     
      Sequential Process: The Waterfall model follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
      Documentation Heavy: Emphasizes thorough documentation and formal reviews at each stage.
      Less Flexible: Changes are difficult to implement once the process is underway.
      Preferred Scenarios: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and low uncertainty, such as regulatory and compliance-driven projects.

Agile Model:
      
      Iterative Process: Agile follows an iterative and incremental approach, where development is divided into small, manageable units called sprints.
      Customer Collaboration: Emphasizes continuous customer involvement and feedback.
      Highly Flexible: Easily accommodates changes throughout the development process.
      Preferred Scenarios: Ideal for projects with evolving requirements, high uncertainty, and a need for rapid delivery, such as startups and dynamic business environments.

          Management: Tracking and managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
      Importance: Requirements engineering is crucial because it lays the foundation for all subsequent development activities.

**Question 6:**
_Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?:_
   
     Modularity refers to dividing a software system into discrete, independent modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system's functionality. Each module can be developed, tested, and maintained separately.
    
     Benefits:
          Maintainability: Modular systems are easier to understand, debug, and modify because changes in one module have minimal impact on others.
          Scalability: New features or components can be added without affecting the entire system, making it easier to scale the software.
          Reusability: Modules can be reused across different parts of the system or in different projects, saving time and resources.
          Parallel Development: Different modules can be developed simultaneously by different teams, speeding up the development process.

**Question 7:**
_Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?:_

Testing in Software Engineering:
       
        Unit Testing:
            Focuses on individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly in isolation. Typically performed by developers.
        Integration Testing:
            Tests the interaction between integrated units/modules to identify interface defects. Ensures that combined components work together as expected.
        System Testing:
            Validates the complete and integrated software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements. Conducted in an environment that mimics the production environment.
        Acceptance Testing:
            Performed by end-users or clients to ensure the software meets their needs and requirements. It is the final testing phase before deployment.

**Question 8:**
_What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:_
    
      Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that manage changes to source code over time. They track modifications, enable collaboration, and maintain a history of changes.
          Importance:
               Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
               History: Maintains a history of changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
               Branching and Merging: Facilitates parallel development through branching and simplifies the integration of changes with merging.
          Examples:
               Git:
